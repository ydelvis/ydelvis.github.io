> ðŸ”’ *"Trust, but verify..."* â€” Security philosophy

Hello! I am a PhD Student in Computer Science with a research focus on security and privacy in modern computing systems. My work seeks to design and evaluate mechanisms that make complex infrastructuresâ€”such as cloud platforms, serverless computing environments, and IoT ecosystemsâ€”both secure and usable.

I am particularly interested in approaches that ensure least-privilege access control and data privacy, while also making security controls more intuitive for users and developers. My research often explores information flow control and other policy-driven techniques to reduce risks in distributed and cloud-based architectures.

Beyond cloud and serverless platforms, I also investigate challenges in IoT security and usable security, emphasizing practical solutions that balance technical robustness with human-centered design.

ðŸŽ¯ Research Interests
* Systems Security (Cloud, Serverless, IBN & IoT)
* Least-Privilege Access Control
* Information Flow Control
* Data Privacy
